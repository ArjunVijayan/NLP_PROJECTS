1. Spam/Ham classification -  In a Kaggle competition aimed at predicting whether text messages are ham (non-spam) or spam, a solution was developed that involved two main steps: feature extraction and classification. First, the text messages were converted into numerical features using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer, which captures the importance of words within the messages while reducing the impact of common words. Next, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was employed to classify the messages based on the extracted TF-IDF features. This approach effectively distinguishes between ham and spam messages by leveraging the strengths of both TF-IDF for feature extraction and SVM for classification.


2. Movie review classification - To classify movie reviews as positive or negative, text reviews are cleaned and tokenized. The TF-IDF vectorizer transforms the text into numerical features, capturing word importance. An SVM classifier is then trained on these features to distinguish between positive and negative reviews, leveraging TF-IDF for feature extraction and SVM for effective classification.
